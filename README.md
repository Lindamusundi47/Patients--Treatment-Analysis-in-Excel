# Patients-Treatment-Analysis-in-Excel

### Project Overview

This project presents an exploratory and analytical study of hospital patient treatment data conducted entirely in Microsoft Excel. Since the dataset was already clean and standardized, the workflow emphasized analytical processing, metric computation, and visualization rather than data preprocessing. The analysis aims to identify patterns in patient characteristics, treatment allocation, and healthcare outcomes.

### Dataset Used
-<a href="https://colorstech.net/practise-datasets/hospital-patient-treatment-dataset-for-analysis/">Hospital Patients Treatment </a>

### KPIs

 1.Which treatments are most frequently administered?

 2.How do treatment patterns vary across patient demographics?

 3.Which departments handle the highest patient load?

 4.Are specific treatments associated with better outcomes?

 5.Where can hospital resources be optimized based on demand?

 ### Process of the project

 -Summary statistics of patient and treatment data

-Pivot table analysis to identify patterns and trends

-Visualizations to compare treatments and patient groups

-Filtering and grouping to explore relationships within the data
